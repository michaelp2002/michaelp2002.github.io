    <h1>Michael Ault's Song Recommendations</h1>
    <p> My name is Michael Ault and I am a 4th year studying Computer Science and Business 
        at Northeastern University.  I have a passion for music and discovering 
        new artists.  Music is a way to not only express yourself, but one of the fastest ways to 
        understand others.  </p>
        
    <p> My website will be a hub for all songs I recommended to people.  
        It will include --- </p> 
        <ul>
        <li> A daily recommendation </li>
        <li> Links to playlists </li>
        <li> Information about favorite authors </li>
        </ul>
